      KBase’s Search tool allows you to search for reference data, Narratives, and data within shared Narratives. Type what you are looking for into the search box, press Enter or click the magnifying glass, and KBase will search and list the data and Narratives found. You can also search for reads and assemblies contained in the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Genomes Online Database (GOLD) and add them directly to your Narratives.

      > BETA: This is a beta product, under active development. We encourage you to use the tool and provide feedback to us through our <a href="http://kbase.us/help-board/" target="_blank">public help board</a>.

      ### Searching Data in KBase

      The _User Data_ tab lists the titles and data from your Narratives, all Narratives shared with you, and all public Narratives.

      The _Reference Data_ tab lists data from public reference datasets hosted in KBase that match your search terms. You can quickly and easily add public reference data to your Narratives for analysis.

      ### Enter search terms

      Enter as many search terms as you wish, separated by one or more spaces. Multiple search terms are queried as “AND” statements. The search will find objects or text that include all of the terms you specified. Terms are matched against whole words; no partial matches will be listed. Other search operators and wildcards are not currently supported.

      The search terms apply to indexed properties of objects. All objects that match your search terms will be returned. The results will appear on multiple pages, with the objects grouped by the Narrative they are contained in.

      > Limitations: At present, results are ordered by workspace ID, which is an internal identifier assigned to Narratives in the order in which they are created. The results are therefore presented with the most recent Narrative listed first.

      ### Access Private vs Public User Data

      The _Access_ checkboxes on the right-hand side of the search interface allows you to choose to search for Private or Public _User Data_. Private data is that contained in Narratives you own, or that have been shared with you. Public data is contained in Narratives that the owner made readable to all KBase users. _Reference Data_ is always public, so there is no privacy filtering for it.

      ### Searching JGI Data in KBase

      JGI and KBase have linked our systems to allow all KBase users to search and pull data from JGI GOLD into their staging area. To search JGI data, select “JGI” above the search bar. Currently, users can search for reads and assemblies in JGI to bring into KBase for analysis. Search queries will find matches in an organism’s JGI proposal title, principal investigator, proposal ID, project ID, and scientific name (typically genus, species, and strain). Wildcards are supported; use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard  (for example, “lacto*” would match “lactobacillus” and “lactococcus”). Other search operators are not currently supported.

      You can also set filters for file type (BAM, FASTA, FASTQ), PI last name, proposal ID, and project ID to limit your search results to those matching the filtering criteria.

    title: Viewing Search Results
    content: |

      After searching for data and Narratives in KBase, you can view the search results in a variety of ways that make finding the right data easier. On the right-hand side of the screen next to the search bar, you will find a drop-down menu titled “View.” This menu lets you choose between three different view modes: _Detail_, _Matches_, and _List_.

      _Detail_ view lists the data and text that match the search terms while both highlighting the exact hits for the term and displaying detailed information about the data objects or app cells hit by the search. _Matches_ also lists hits for the search terms and highlights the exact hits, but hides details about the data objects and app cells. _List_ shows the data and Narratives hit by the search term, without any additional details or highlights.

      Once you have found the data you are looking for, you can add it to your existing Narratives or create a new Narrative with your data loaded into it.

      ### Adding KBase Data to Narratives

      Each of the hits in your list of search results has a checkbox to the left of the listing. Check these boxes for all of the data you wish to copy into a Narrative, and then click the “Copy Selected” button to the right of the search bar. This will bring up a dialog box that lets you select “Copy into New Narrative” or “Copy into an existing Narrative” depending on where you want to move the data.

      ### Adding JGI Data to Narratives

      Adding JGI data from Search into your Narratives takes a few more steps. After searching and locating the data you want to add from the list of results, notice that on the right-hand side of each listing there is a “Copy” button. Clicking the “Copy” button brings up a dialog to “Copy File to Staging.” In this dialog, you can set a custom name for the data you are transferring, then click “Copy File to your Staging Area” to move it to your Staging Area. This begins a transfer process that you can monitor by clicking “Close and Monitor Jobs” in this dialog, or “View Staging Jobs” in the main Search interface.

      The files in your Staging Area are ready to import into your Narrative as KBase data objects that can be used in your analyses. <a href="http://kbase.us/narrative-guide/add-data-to-your-narrative-2/#upload" target="_blank">Access your Staging Area</a> through the “Import” tab of the data slideout in your Narrative. To import a file from your Staging Area, choose a data type from the format pulldown menu to the right of the file’s age. Then click the blue “Import” icon to the right of the format menu. When you click the “Import” icon, the data slideout closes and an Import app cell is created in your Narrative, with the appropriate parameters filled in. You can change the output object name, if desired, and then click the Run button to start the import. When the import is done, you should see the message “Finished with success” near the top of the app cell, and in your Data Panel you should see the new data object, ready to be used in KBase apps.

      # Markdown Test

      This section is here to exercise all Markdown styling to ensure that our styles work well.

      ## Paragraphs

      This is a paragraph. It is long enough, I believe, to ensure that wrapping occurs. Let's make sure that wrapping is a good readable line length.

      Markdown does let you
      break lines however
      you
      like
      and keep them as a whole paragraph.

      You can also override this with two
      or more spaces
      at the end of a line.

      ## Font Styles

      Now we turn to the font styles. The basic ones are *emphasis* (usually *italics*) and **strong** (aka **bold**).

      The less common ~~strikethrough~~.

      They can all be combined? *__italic bold__*, **_bold italic**, **~~bold strikethrough~~**, ad nauseum.

      ## Links

      Links are not encouraged in help text, rather please use the "references" section in the help config file.

      We may come up with a more sophisticated method of linking (e.g. to provide links within the ui) but not yet.

      ## Embedding Images

      Images should not be embedded directly into a document, but used as references. Images are stored in locally in the plugin
      in the resources/images directory. You should use the special prefix $IMAGES/ with your images. The help viewer will translate
      these into the correct format for loading images in the ui.


      ## Headers

      # Header 1

      The top level "header 1" is signfied by one "#", so e.g. ```# Header 1``` above. THe Header 1 may be too big to use in embedded markdown, like this help tool. Logically, though, it is the primary organizing topic of the current page.

      ## Header 2

      Main sections should be header 2.

      ### Header 3

      The third level header is for section topics.

      #### Header 4

      We should use the low level headers sparingly.

      ##### Header 5

      Finally, the fifth level header is a rare beast, and is as low (or high) as we support.
