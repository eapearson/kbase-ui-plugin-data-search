      The *Search* tool allows you to search across Narratives, Reference, and Example data. Your search will reach into all Workspaces to which you have access, including **you own**, those **shared with you**, and those which are **shared with all users (public)**.

      _Enter search terms_

      Enter as many search terms as you wish, separated by one or more spaces. All of the terms you enter will be "and"ed together to restrict the search.

      The search terms apply to indexed properties of objects. All objects which match the search terms will be returned, on multiple pages, grouped by the Narrative they are contained in.

      > Limitations: At present results are ordered 

      _Private vs Public Data_

      For _User Objects_, you may select whether to search across private data only, public data only, or both. Private data is that contained in Narratives you own, or have been shared with you. Public data is contained in Narratives which are made readable to all KBase users.

      # Markdown Test

      This section is here to exercise all Markdown styling to ensure that our styles work well.

      ## Paragraphs

      This is a paragraph. It is long enough, I believe, to ensure that wrapping occurs. Let's make sure that wrapping is a good readable line length.

      Markdown does let you
      break lines however
      you
      like
      and keep them as a whole paragraph.

      You can also override this with two  
      or more spaces  
      at the end of a line.

      ## Font Styles

      Now we turn to the font styles. The basic ones are *emphasis* (usually *italics*) and **strong** (aka **bold**). 
      
      The less common ~~strikethrough~~. 
      
      They can all be combined? *__italic bold__*, **_bold italic**, **~~bold strikethrough~~**, ad nauseum.

      ## Header Styles

      

      ## Links

      Links are not encouraged in help text, rather please use the "references" section in the help config file.

      We may come up with a more sophisticated method of linking (e.g. to provide links within the ui) but not yet.

      ## Embedding Images

      Images should not be embedded directly into a document, but used as references. Images are stored in locally in the plugin
      in the resources/images directory. You should use the special prefix $IMAGES/ with your images. The help viewer will translate 
      these into the correct format for loading images in the ui.
